overall to do: calculate GC content at 4D sites in non-gametologous regions

things needed:
- plus NG fasta (in `aligned-fastas`)
- annotation table parser - 4D sites defined as intronic/intergenic/4D annotations in there
- script to transpose fasta? the coordinates should match the mt+ though... might not need transposition here
- script that iterates through alignment one base at a time, checks 4D status, and calculates GC if true
